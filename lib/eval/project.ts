/**
 * The project's eval (template spec §5.11): its cases, how one runs, how its answer scores, and
 * README line 1's sentence. Project-owned: a project replaces the sample with its own cases
 * (measurements/cases.json, frozen before its first run), its runCase and its scorer, and keeps
 * the EVAL_PROJECT export, which `pnpm eval` reads (scripts/eval.ts), and EVALS_PAGE, which the
 * Evals pages read (template spec §5.12). Server-only.
 *
 * The template's eval is a sample to replace: three cases asked once each to the model with the
 * sample tool of lib/tools.ts, scored by the tools the answer called and the phrases its reply
 * holds. A chat project runs each case through its chat's own pipeline instead (its instructions,
 * tools and limits), so the eval measures what a visitor gets. The sample calls the model
 * directly, with no import from lib/chat/, so it survives the removal recipe of a project without
 * a chat (template spec §9 step 6b).
